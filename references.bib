  abstract = {Many questions remain about the causes and implications of state government
	reorganization. Using an original data set on agency consolidation
	in the states between 1950 and 1992, we show that executive branch
	restructuring occurs incrementally as well as through better recognized
	comprehensive reorganization. With continuous state-space modeling
	we show that these different reform paths are related and driven
	by distinct political and economic conditions. We also show that,
	contrary to previous findings, state attempts to alter their administrative
	organizations do impact long-term employment growth rates. Although
	smaller in magnitude, incremental as well as comprehensive reforms
	can enhance administrative efficiency. Further, unlike the Baumgartner
	and Jones (1993, 2002) punctuated-equilibrium model, we do not find
	evidence that incrementalism gives way to bursts of nonincremental
	change. Rather, incremental adjustments to the status quo may be
	sufficient to reduce the possibility the possibility of comprehensive
	reorganization at any point in the future.},

	first an individual's judgment that a value in a given set of data

	The conventional frequency interpretation of the significance level
	for outlier tests is shown to be invalid and an experiment designed
	to investigate the inherent subjective nature of outlier procedures
	is described. This confirms that there are variations both between
	individuals in their reaction to surprising values and also between
	judgments made by the same individual on different occasions. The
	method of presentation of the data is shown to affect an individual's
	ability to perceive possible outliers. More surprising, it turns
	out that factors such as scale and pattern of the data are also very
	relevant.},

	democratization in emerging market economies by focusing on the currency
	markets of four Asian countries at different stages of democratic
	development. Using political data of various kinds-including a new
	events data series-and the Markov regime switching model from empirical
	macroeconomics, we show that in young and incipient democracies politics
	continuously causes changes in the probability of experiencing two
	different currency market equilibria: a high volatility "contagion"
	regime and a low volatility "fundamentals" regime. The kind of political
	events that affect currency market equilibration varies cross-nationally
	depending on the degree to which the polity of a country is democratic
	and its policymaking transparent. The results help us better gauge
	how and the extent to which democratization is compatible with financial
	globalization.},

  abstract = {This article studies the consequences of inter- and intrastate wars
	for economic growth in a large cross-section of countries during
	the period 1960-89. It establishes that cross-country differences
	in economic growth are systematically related to the severity and
	duration of war. The combined prewar, contemporaneous, and postwar
	association between growth and war is negative; that is, economic
	performance has been lower in countries that fought a severe and/or
	prolonged war. However, the causal effect of war on postwar economic
	performance is positive. In particular, the longer or more severe
	the war, the higher the subsequent long-term rate of economic growth.
	A possible interpretation of these findings is that war is more likely
	to occur in poorly performing countries and/or to have a negative
	direct - contemporaneous - effect on growth. But in the longer term,
	war creates growth-enhancing possibilities. Interestingly, these
	effects arise mostly from civil wars and are quantitatively quite
	substantial. For instance, an increase in war duration by 10% leads
	to an increase of 2.1% in the average growth rate. The findings of
	this article are thus consistent with the predictions of the theories
	of both Organski & Kugler and Olson.},

	and volatility of stock prices is affected both by government partisanship
	and by traders' expectations of electoral victory by the right-wing
	or left-wing party. Our model predicts that rational expectations
	of higher inflation under left-wing administrations lowers the volume
	of stocks traded in the stock market. The decline in trading volume
	leads to a decrease in the mean and volatility of stock prices not
	only during the incumbency of left-wing governments, but also when
	traders expect the left-wing party to win elections. Conversely,
	expectation of lower inflation under right-wing administrations leads
	to higher trading volume. This leads to an increase in the mean and
	volatility of stock prices during the tenure of right-wing governments
	and when traders anticipate the right-wing party to win elections.
	Daily and monthly data from U.S. and British equity markets between
	1930 and 2000 statistically corroborate the predictions from our
	formal model.},

	model of government growth, based on a long historical dataset, for
	Italy. Our long-run analysis shows a permanent influence of domestic
	product on the growth of governments, supporting Wagner's law. The
	short-run dynamics are more complex and provide some evidence for
	the displacement effect, in terms of a lower resistance against tax-financing
	of government spending in the post-war. In addition, government spending
	adjusts faster when deviations from its equilibrium get larger.},

abstract = {Context
Topic modeling finds human-readable structures in unstructured textual data. A widely used topic modeling technique is Latent Dirichlet allocation. When running on different datasets, LDA suffers from âorder effectsâ, i.e., different topics are generated if the order of training data is shuffled. Such order effects introduce a systematic error for any study. This error can relate to misleading results; specifically, inaccurate topic descriptions and a reduction in the efficacy of text mining classification results.
Objective
To provide a method in which distributions generated by LDA are more stable and can be used for further analysis.
Method
We use LDADE, a search-based software engineering tool which uses Differential Evolution (DE) to tune the LDAâs parameters. LDADE is evaluated on data from a programmer information exchange site (Stackoverflow), title and abstract text of thousands of Software Engineering (SE) papers, and software defect reports from NASA. Results were collected across different implementations of LDA (Python+Scikit-Learn, Scala+Spark) across Linux platform and for different kinds of LDAs (VEM, Gibbs sampling). Results were scored via topic stability and text mining classification accuracy.
Results
In all treatments: (i) standard LDA exhibits very large topic instability; (ii) LDADEâs tunings dramatically reduce cluster instability; (iii) LDADE also leads to improved performances for supervised as well as unsupervised learning.
Conclusion
Due to topic instability, using standard LDA with its âoff-the-shelfâ settings should now be depreciated. Also, in future, we should require SE papers that use LDA to test and (if needed) mitigate LDA topic instability. Finally, LDADE is a candidate technology for effectively and efficiently reducing that instability.}

It has been previously shown that Kendall's W is proportional to the average of the rank correlations of all pairs of rankings in a single group and that Page's L is essentially the average of the rank correlations of an external ranking with each ranking in a group suggested by Lyerly. Similarly L is here shown to be directly related to the average of all rank correlations between a ranking from one group with a ranking from the other group. This statistic is also equal to the total of the L statistics calculated for each judge in one group with all judges in the other. The L statistic is shown to be uncorrelated with Kendall's W for concordance within either group. The asymptotic normality of L is established. A modification for ties is reported.},

The availability of rank ordered choice set data leads to an "explosion" or decomposition procedure for exploiting such extra information. This "explosion" process involves the decomposition of a ranked choice set into a series of unranked and statistically independent choice sets. In relation to explosion strategies, several heuristics and an analytical procedure for determining the "optimal" explosion depth are discussed in detail. The results of a Montï¿½ Carlo study of the small sample properties of the conditional logit estimation procedure (the maximum likelihood estimation procedure used to develop parameter estimates of the multinomial logit model formulation of the stochastic utility model) are reported and interpreted. A college choice empirical application illustrates the procedures developed.},
