	abstract = {Loneliness is increasingly recognised as the next critical public health issue. A plausible reason for this concern may be related to emerging societal trends affecting the way we relate, communicate, and function in our social environment. In 2006, a prominent review of the clinical significance of loneliness was published. However, there has not been a comprehensive update on known and emerging risk factors and correlates of loneliness since then. Furthermore, there is no conceptual model that has been developed to better account for the complexity of loneliness and to inform the development of evidence-based solutions as we challenge the issues of the twenty-first century.},

	abstract = {Government policy has been an important determinant of Chinese migration patterns since the founding of the People’s Republic. The main migration stream for the rural population, especially since the readjustment of migration policy, has been rural-to-urban. The general trend of internal migration in China involves two coexistent patterns: the one organized and planned, the other essentially spontaneous and unplanned. The pattern of migration in urban China is like that of neither well developed nor developing countries. In China, there is more fluctuation in the rate; greater demographic similarity among migrants, irrespective of destination; and more government control as to quantity, direction and composition. The core of migration policy in China is the exercise of control over the volume of movement into the cities, especially into the extra-large and large cities. Migration between cities of the same size should be freely permitted and two-way migration between cities of different size opened up.},
